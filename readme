mocha
=====

This is the main repository for the mocha project, and it contains the xc
compiler/build system, the mocha standard library along with documentation
found in doc/.


Syntax
------
Mocha syntax excels at being simple, legible, and fast to type. An example
function that adds two 32-bit integers:

   function name          return type
   ⌄                      ⌄
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       ⌃
       32-bit integer argument

    ret a + b
}


Build
-----

- xc
   $ cd xc && make

Documentation
-------------

You can read the documentation here on GitHub in the doc/ directory, or you can
generate a HTML page by running ./generate-html.py in the doc/ directory, which
will create an index.html with all the links.
