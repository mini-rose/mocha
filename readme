coffee
======

This is the main repository for the coffee project, and it contains the
nxg compiler/build system, the Coffee standard library along with some other tools
for operating on the language.


Syntax
------
Coffee syntax excels at being simple, legible, and fast to type. An example
function that adds two 32-bit integers:

   function name          return type
   ˅                      v
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
       ˄
       32-bit integer argument

    ret a + b
}


Build
-----

- nxg
   $ cd nxg
   $ meson setup build
   $ meson compile -C build

Documention
-----------

You can read the documentation here on GitHub in the doc/ directory, or you can
generate a HTML page by running ./generate-html.py in the doc/ directory, which
will create an index.html with all the links.
